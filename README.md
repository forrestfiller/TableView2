# TableView2
Basic iOS app in Swift using a tableView to show TV show information, end of week 2.
**In Progress**
The app has random show's pulled off of the internet, there may be some minor errors in 
content, such as directors, cast members, etc.

Goal of this app is to be able to work with the tableView (which we created in the IB),
as well as programmatically creating the UI for the first time.
